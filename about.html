                <h2>Anna Gilthorpe</h2>
                <p>Anna began life as a winner - she was voted "baby with the most tuneful wail" in St Whyayeman's Maternity Hospital, Newcastle, in the year of our Lord, none of your business. She had a successful pre-school career as a wombat wrestler, gaining several world titles along the way. Her love of music was the cause of her time at convent school being cut short - that, and the nuns discovering the protection racket she was running with several other, somewhat unsavoury, older girls. Escaping from the school, she joined Abigail Snufflebucket's Travelling Opera Company, and spent the next several years touring the world, to great acclaim. Growing tired of the adoration of some of the world's most eligible millionaires, Anna returned to England and is now studying front end web development: a career she will no doubt excel at. But she will be avoiding jQuery as much as possible.</p>

                <h2>Ashley Cook</h2>
                <p>Ashley's past is a mix of myth, conjecture, and a sprinkling of legend. If you were to listen to the gossip, you would think Ashley had been everything from a ninja assassin to the Grand Master of The Order of the Knights Templar, with stints as a goat herder, snail farmer and children's party entertainer along the way. What <em>is</em> known for sure is that he was part of a secret brotherhood of vampire hunters, operating for many years in the Carpathians. Some would say successfully. The more clear-sighted might opt for "haphazardly". Either way, they certainly racked up an impressive body count. After hearing the words, "NO, NO, YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG PERSON!" shouted one too many times, Ashley resolved to find a different way of life. His new vocation was revealed to him in a dream one night after eating a large, slightly out of date, block of cheese. He returned home and is now involved in the exciting field of front end web development.</p>

                <p>Much like the description of the planet Earth in The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy, James is best described as "mostly harmless".</p>
