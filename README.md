## Tech Used

<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>Ticketmaster API</li>
  <li>Booking.com API</li>
</ul>

Our market research revealed a real world problem in the form of the lack of an app which combined the ability to book concert tickets and then book accomodation in the area local to the concert venue. We set out to do this by using Ticketmaster's API combined with Airbnb's API. Unfortunately, Airbnb are very precious about who uses their API, so we eventually decided to use Booking.com's API via the website Rapidapi.com.

The process is in small steps: first choose the area you wish to see your favourite band in; then search for the name of the band or artist you wish to see. If your chosen artist is performing on that area in the near future, then this information is returned from the Ticketmaster APi and you can click through and purchase tickets from Ticketmaster.

Should the journey to see your chosen act be a long one, the option is on the same page to search for accomodation in the vicinity of the concert venue. There is a calendar facility for the user to specify checking in and checking out dates.
